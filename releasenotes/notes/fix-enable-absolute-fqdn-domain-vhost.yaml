  **Fixed** an issue where Istio's outbound route configuration did not include the absolute/fully qualified domain name (FQDN) variant (with trailing dot) in the domains list for VirtualHost entries. This ensures that requests using absolute FQDNs (ending with a dot, e.g., `my-service.my-ns.svc.cluster.local.`) are properly routed to the intended service instead of falling back to PassthroughCluster.
