// EventHandler enqueues reconcile.Requests in response to events (e.g. Pod Create).  EventHandlers map an Event
// for one object to trigger Reconciles for either the same object or different objects - e.g. if there is an
// Event for object with type Foo (using source.KindSource) then reconcile one or more object(s) with type Bar.
//
// Identical reconcile.Requests will be batched together through the queuing mechanism before reconcile is called.
//
// * Use EnqueueRequestForObject to reconcile the object the event is for
// - do this for events for the type the Controller Reconciles. (e.g. Deployment for a Deployment Controller)
//
// * Use EnqueueRequestForOwner to reconcile the owner of the object the event is for
// - do this for events for the types the Controller creates.  (e.g. ReplicaSets created by a Deployment Controller)
//
// * Use EnqueueRequestFromMapFunc to transform an event for an object to a reconcile of an object
// of a different type - do this for events for types the Controller may be interested in, but doesn't create.
// (e.g. If Foo responds to cluster size events, map Node events to Foo objects.)
//
// Unless you are implementing your own EventHandler, you can ignore the functions on the EventHandler interface.
// Most users shouldn't need to implement their own EventHandler.
