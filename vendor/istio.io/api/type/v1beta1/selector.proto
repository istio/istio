// to a proxy. The matching criteria includes the metadata associated with a proxy,
// workload instance info such as labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other info
// that the proxy provides to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are
// specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload instance to be
// selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.
