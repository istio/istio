releaseNotes:
- |
  **Fixed** XDS debug endpoints (syncz, config_dump) to require authentication.
  Previously accessible without authentication on plaintext XDS port 15010.
  Controlled by ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINT_AUTH (same flag as HTTP debug endpoints).

upgradeNotes:
- title: XDS debug endpoints now require authentication
  content: |
    XDS debug endpoints (syncz, config_dump) on port 15010 now require authentication.
    This affects istioctl commands using --plaintext flag and custom tooling using plaintext XDS.
    To restore previous behavior, set ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINT_AUTH=false.
