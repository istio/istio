    **Improved**: A feature flag has been added to control the strictness of gateway merging.
    When enabled, GatewayAPI gateways will not be merged with Istio Gateways.
    The flag is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the `PILOT_ENABLE_STRICT_GATEWAY_MERGING` environment variable to `false`.
