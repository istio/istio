    **Fixed** - an issue where the app probes were getting rewritten for all the ports for a pod even if istio does NOT intend to intercept the traffic to that port. With this fix, we account for `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts` and `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeInboundPorts` annotations before rewriting the probes.
