<p>Configuration affecting traffic routing. Here are a few terms useful to define
in the context of traffic routing.</p>

<p><em>Service</em> a unit of application behavior bound to a unique name in a
service registry. Services consist of multiple network <em>endpoints</em>
implemented by workload instances running on pods, containers, VMs etc.</p>

<p><em>Service versions (subsets)</em> - In a continuous deployment scenario, for
a given service, there can be distinct subsets of instances running
different variants of the application binary. These variants are not
necessarily different API versions. They could be iterative changes to
the same service, deployed in different environments (prod, staging,
dev, etc.). Common scenarios where this occurs include A/B testing,
canary rollouts, etc. The choice of a particular version can be decided
based on various criterion (headers, url, etc.) and/or by weights
assigned to each version. Each service has a default version consisting
of all its instances.</p>

<p><em>Source</em> - A downstream client calling a service.</p>

<p><em>Host</em> - The address used by a client when attempting to connect to a
service.</p>

<p><em>Access model</em> - Applications address only the destination service
(Host) without knowledge of individual service versions (subsets). The
actual choice of the version is determined by the proxy/sidecar, enabling the
application code to decouple itself from the evolution of dependent
services.</p>

<h2 id="ConnectionPoolSettings">ConnectionPoolSettings</h2>
<section>
<p>Connection pool settings for an upstream host. The settings apply to
each individual host in the upstream service.  See Envoy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/circuit_breaking">circuit
breaker</a>
for more details. Connection pool settings can be applied at the TCP
level as well as at HTTP level.</p>

<p>For example, the following rule sets a limit of 100 connections to redis
service called myredissrv with a connect timeout of 30ms</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

<h2 id="Destination">Destination</h2>
<section>
<p>Destination indicates the network addressable service to which the
request/connection will be sent after processing a routing rule. The
destination.name should unambiguously refer to a service in the service
registry. It can be a short name or a fully qualified domain name from
the service registry, a resolvable DNS name, an IP address or a service
name from the service registry and a subset name. The order of inference
is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Service registry lookup. The entire name is looked up in the service
registry. If the lookup succeeds, the search terminates. The requests
will be routed to any instance of the service in the mesh. When the
service name consists of a single word, the FQDN will be constructed in
a platform specific manner. For example, in Kubernetes, the namespace
associated with the routing rule will be used to identify the service as
<servicename>.<rulenamespace>. However, if the service name contains
multiple words separated by a dot (e.g., reviews.prod), the name in its
entirety would be looked up in the service registry.</p></li>

<li><p>Runtime DNS lookup by the proxy. If step 1 fails, and the name is not
an IP address, it will be considered as a DNS name that is not in the
service registry (e.g., wikipedia.org). The sidecar/gateway will resolve
the DNS and load balance requests appropriately. See Envoy&rsquo;s strict_dns
for details.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The following example routes all traffic by default to pods of the
reviews service with label &ldquo;version: v1&rdquo; (i.e., subset v1), and some
to subset v2, in a kubernetes environment.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews # namespace is same as the client/caller's namespace
  http:

    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/wpcatalog&quot;
    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/consumercatalog&quot;
    rewrite:
      uri: &quot;/newcatalog&quot;
    route:
    - destination:
        name: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        name: reviews
        subset: v1
</code></pre>

<p>And the associated DestinationRule</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
spec:
  name: reviews
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
</code></pre>

<p>The following VirtualService sets a timeout of 5s for all calls to
productpage.prod service. Notice that there are no subsets defined in
this rule. Istio will fetch all instances of productpage.prod service
from the service registry and populate the sidecar&rsquo;s load balancing
pool.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-productpage-rule
spec:
  hosts:
  - productpage.prod # in kubernetes, this applies only to prod namespace
  http:
  - timeout: 5s
    route:
    - destination:
        name: productpage.prod
</code></pre>

<p>The following sets a timeout of 5s for all calls to the external
service wikipedia.org, as there is no internal service of that name.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-wiki-rule
spec:
  hosts:

<p>If short names are used, the FQDN of the service will be resolved in a
platform specific manner. For example in Kubernetes, when a route with a
short name &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; in the destination in namespace &ldquo;bookinfo&rdquo; is applied,
the final destination is resolved to reviews.bookinfo.svc.cluster.local. The
sidecar will route to the IP
addresses of the pods constituting the service. However, if the lookup
fails, &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; is treated as an external service, such that the sidecar
will dynamically resolve the DNS of the service name and route the request
to the IP addresses returned by the DNS.</p>

<p>Names must comply with DNS label syntax (rfc1035) and therefore cannot
collide with numbers. If there are multiple ports on a service with
the same protocol the names should be of the form <protocol-name>-<DNS
label>.</p>

</section>
<h2 id="DestinationRule">DestinationRule</h2>
<section>
<p>DestinationRule defines policies that apply to traffic intended for a
service after routing has occurred. These rules specify configuration
for load balancing, connection pool size from the sidecar, and outlier
detection settings to detect and evict unhealthy hosts from the load
balancing pool. For example, a simple load balancing policy for the
ratings service would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-ratings
spec:
  name: ratings
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: LEAST_CONN
</code></pre>

<p>Version specific policies can be specified by defining a named
subset and overriding the settings specified at the service level. The
following rule uses a round robin load balancing policy for all traffic
going to a subset named testversion that is composed of endpoints (e.g.,
pods) with labels (version:v3).</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-ratings
spec:
  name: ratings
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: LEAST_CONN
  subsets:
  - name: testversion
    labels:
      version: v3
    trafficPolicy:
      loadBalancer:
        simple: ROUND_ROBIN
</code></pre>

<p>Note that policies specified for subsets will not take effect until
a route rule explicitly sends traffic to this subset.</p>

<p>REQUIRED. The destination address for traffic captured by this
rule.  Could be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or a CIDR
prefix. Depending on the platform, short-names can also be used
instead of a FQDN (i.e. has no dots in the name). In such a scenario,
the FQDN of the host would be derived based on the underlying
platform.</p>

<p>For example on Kubernetes, when hosts contains a short name, Istio will
interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule.  Thus, when a
client applies a rule in the &ldquo;default&rdquo; namespace, containing a name
&ldquo;reviews&rdquo;, Istio will setup routes to the
&ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo; service. However, if a different name
such as &ldquo;reviews.sales&rdquo; is used, it would be treated as a FQDN during
virtual host matching.  In Consul, a plain service name would be resolved to
the FQDN &ldquo;reviews.service.consul&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Note that the hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP
services. Service inside the mesh, i.e. those found in the service
registry, must always be referred to using their alphanumeric
names. IP addresses or CIDR prefixes are allowed only for services
defined via the Gateway.</p>

instances with the &ldquo;v2&rdquo; tag and the remaining traffic (i.e., 75%) to
&ldquo;v1&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="ExternalService">ExternalService</h2>
<section>
<p>External service describes the endpoints, ports and protocols of a
white-listed set of mesh-external domains and IP blocks that services in
the mesh are allowed to access.</p>

<p>For example, the following external service configuration describes the
set of services at https://example.com to be accessed internally over
plaintext http (i.e. http://example.com:443), with the sidecar originating
TLS.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ExternalService
metadata:
  name: external-svc-example
spec:
  hosts:
  - example.com
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: example-http
    protocol: http # not HTTPS.
  discovery: DNS
</code></pre>

<p>and a destination rule to initiate TLS connections to the external service.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: tls-example
spec:
  name: example.com
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE # initiates HTTPS when talking to example.com
</code></pre>

<p>The following specification specifies a static set of backend nodes for
a MongoDB cluster behind a set of virtual IPs, and sets up a destination
rule to initiate mTLS connections upstream.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ExternalService
metadata:
  name: external-svc-mongocluster
spec:
  hosts:
  - 192.192.192.192/24
  ports:
  - number: 27018
    name: mongodb
    protocol: mongo
  discovery: STATIC
  endpoints:
  - address: 2.2.2.2
  - address: 3.3.3.3
</code></pre>

<p>and the associated destination rule</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: mtls-mongocluster
spec:
  name: 192.192.192.192/24
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: MUTUAL
      clientCertificate: /etc/certs/myclientcert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/client_private_key.pem
      caCertificates: /etc/certs/rootcacerts.pem
</code></pre>

<p>The following example demonstrates the use of wildcards in the hosts. If
the connection has to be routed to the IP address requested by the
application (i.e. application resolves DNS and attempts to connect to a
specific IP), the discovery mode must be set to &ldquo;none&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ExternalService
metadata:
  name: external-svc-wildcard-example
spec:
  hosts:
  - &quot;*.bar.com&quot;
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: http
  discovery: NONE
</code></pre>

<p>For HTTP based services, it is possible to create a virtual service
backed by multiple DNS addressible endpoints. In such a scenario, the
application can use the HTTP_PROXY environment variable to transparently
reroute API calls for the virtual service to a chosen backend. For
example, the following configuration creates a non-existent service
called foo.bar.com backed by three domains: us.foo.bar.com:8443,
uk.foo.bar.com:9443, and in.foo.bar.com:7443</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ExternalService
metadata:
  name: external-svc-dns
spec:
  hosts:
  - foo.bar.com
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: http
  discovery: DNS
  endpoints:
  - address: us.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      https: 8443
  - address: uk.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      https: 9443
  - address: in.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      https: 7443
</code></pre>

<p>and a destination rule to initiate TLS connections to the external service.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: tls-foobar
spec:
  name: foo.bar.com
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE # initiates HTTPS
</code></pre>

<p>With HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:443, calls from the application to
http://foo.bar.com will be upgraded to HTTPS and load balanced across
the three domains specified above. In other words, a call to
http://foo.bar.com/baz would be translated to
https://uk.foo.bar.com/baz.</p>

<p>NOTE: In the scenario above, the value of the HTTP Authority/host header
associated with the outbound HTTP requests will be based on the
endpoint&rsquo;s DNS name, i.e. &ldquo;:authority: uk.foo.bar.com&rdquo;. Refer to Envoy&rsquo;s
auto<em>host</em>rewrite for further details. The automatic rewrite can be
overridden using a host rewrite route rule.</p>

<section>
<p>Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh
receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. The specification
describes a set of ports that should be exposed, the type of protocol to
use, SNI configuration for the load balancer, etc.</p>

<p>For example, the following gateway spec sets up a proxy to act as a load
balancer exposing port 80 and 9080 (http), 443 (https), and port 2379
(TCP) for ingress.  The gateway will be applied to the proxy running on
a pod with labels &ldquo;app: my-gateway-controller&rdquo;. While Istio will configure the
proxy to listen on these ports, it is the responsibility of the user to
ensure that external traffic to these ports are allowed into the mesh.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-gatweway-controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
    hosts:
    - uk.bookinfo.com
    - eu.bookinfo.com
    tls:
      httpsRedirect: true # sends 302 redirect for http requests
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
    hosts:
    - uk.bookinfo.com
    - eu.bookinfo.com
    tls:
      mode: simple #enables HTTPS on this port
      serverCertificate: /etc/certs/servercert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/privatekey.pem
  - port:
      number: 9080
      name: http-wildcard
    # no hosts implies wildcard match
  - port:
      number: 2379 #to expose internal service via external port 2379
      name: Mongo
      protocol: MONGO
</code></pre>

<p>The gateway specification above describes the L4-L6 properties of a load
balancer. A VirtualService can then be bound to a gateway to control
the forwarding of traffic arriving at a particular host or gateway port.</p>

<p>For example, the following VirtualService splits traffic for
https://uk.bookinfo.com/reviews, https://eu.bookinfo.com/reviews,
http://uk.bookinfo.com:9080/reviews, http://eu.bookinfo.com:9080/reviews
into two versions (prod and qa) of an internal reviews service on port
9080. In addition, requests containing the cookie user: dev-123 will be
sent to special port 7777 in the qa version. The same rule is also
applicable inside the mesh for requests to the reviews.prod
service. This rule is applicable across ports 443, 9080. Note that
http://uk.bookinfo.com gets redirected to https://uk.bookinfo.com
(i.e. 80 redirects to 443).</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-rule
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod
  - uk.bookinfo.com
  - eu.bookinfo.com
  gateways:
  - my-gateway
  - mesh # applies to all the sidecars in the mesh
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        cookie:
          user: dev-123
    route:
    - destination:
        port:
          number: 7777
        name: reviews.qa
  - match:
      uri:
        prefix: /reviews/
    route:
    - destination:
        port:
          number: 9080 # can be omitted if its the only port for reviews
        name: reviews.prod
      weight: 80
    - destination:
        name: reviews.qa
      weight: 20
</code></pre>

<p>The following VirtualService forwards traffic arriving at (external) port
2379 from 172.17.16.0/24 subnet to internal Mongo server on port 5555. This
rule is not applicable internally in the mesh as the gateway list omits
the reserved name &ldquo;mesh&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is
addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific
protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service
(or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.</p>

<p>The source of traffic can also be matched in a routing rule. This allows routing
to be customized for specific client contexts.</p>

<p>The following example routes all HTTP traffic by default to
pods of the reviews service with label &ldquo;version: v1&rdquo;. In addition,
HTTP requests containing /wpcatalog/, /consumercatalog/ url prefixes will
be rewritten to /newcatalog and sent to pods with label &ldquo;version: v2&rdquo;. The
rules will be applied at the gateway named &ldquo;bookinfo&rdquo; as well as at all
the sidecars in the mesh (indicated by the reserved gateway name
&ldquo;mesh&rdquo;).</p>

&ldquo;reviews, Istio will setup routes to the &ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;
service. However, if a different name such as &ldquo;reviews.sales.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;
is used, it would be treated as a FQDN during virtual host matching.
In Consul, a plain service name would be resolved to the FQDN
&ldquo;reviews.service.consul&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Note that the hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP
services. Service inside the mesh, i.e., those found in the service
registry, must always be referred to using their alphanumeric
names. IP addresses or CIDR prefixes are allowed only for services
defined via the Gateway.</p>

<p>The names of gateways and sidecars that should apply these routes. A
single VirtualService is used for sidecars inside the mesh as well
as for one or more gateways. The selection condition imposed by this field
can be overridden using the source field in the match conditions of HTTP/TCP
routes. The reserved word &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; is used to imply all the sidecars in
the mesh. When this field is omitted, the default gateway (&ldquo;mesh&rdquo;)
will be used, which would apply the rule to all sidecars in the
mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the rules will apply
only to the gateways. To apply the rules to both gateways and sidecars,
specify &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; as one of the gateway names.</p>
