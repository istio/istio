  **Added** automatic gRPC Java compatibility for trailing dot virtual hosts. gRPC Java clients are now 
  auto-detected and receive hostnames without trailing dots (e.g., `foo.svc.cluster.local` instead of 
  `foo.svc.cluster.local.`), as gRPC Java's hostname validation rejects trailing dots. Override per-client 
  by setting `TRAILING_DOT: "true"` or `TRAILING_DOT: "false"` in xDS node metadata.
