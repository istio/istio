### Profiles

Istio Helm charts have a concept of a `profile`, which is a bundled collection of value presets.
These can be set with `--set profile=<profile>`.
For example, the `demo` profile offers a preset configuration to try out Istio in a test environment, with additional features enabled and lowered resource requirements.

For consistency, the same profiles are used across each chart, even if they do not impact a given chart.

Explicitly set values have highest priority, then profile settings, then chart defaults.

As an implementation detail of profiles, the default values for the chart are all nested under `defaults`.
When configuring the chart, you should not include this.
That is, `--set some.field=true` should be passed, not `--set defaults.some.field=true`.
