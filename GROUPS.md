# Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into *working groups*.

Working groups follow the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines although each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on
their needs and workflow.

When the need arises, a new working group can be created, please contact the [istio-core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-core)
working group if you think a new group is necessary.

The working groups generate design docs which are kept in a [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIS5p3eW9BCtUk9PVA) and
are available for anyone to read. You have to request access to the drive, something we're stuck with sadly, but once you do
you'll have access to all the docs and won't need to request access for each of them individually.
