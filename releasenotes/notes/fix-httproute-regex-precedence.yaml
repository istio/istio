    **Fixed** an issue where HTTPRoute `RegularExpression` path matches were not prioritized over `PathPrefix` matches, causing incorrect route selection when both match types could match the same path. RegularExpression matches are now correctly evaluated before PathPrefix matches, ensuring more specific routes are matched first.
