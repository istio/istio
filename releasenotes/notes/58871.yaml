    **Added** `disableContextPropagation` field to the Telemetry Tracing API, allowing users to disable
    trace context header propagation (e.g., `X-B3-*`, `traceparent`) independently from span reporting.
    This is useful for preventing trace context leakage at egress gateways while maintaining internal observability.
