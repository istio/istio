  **Fixed** DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges` and `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts`. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.
