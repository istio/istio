                            negation.  The two types of negation are subtly different.
                            One negates the set of matched endpoints, the other negates
                            the whole match: \n \tSelector = \"!has(my_label)\" matches

                            = \"has(my_label)\" matches packets that are not from
                            Calico-controlled \tendpoints that do have the label \"my_label\".
                            \n The effect is that the latter will accept packets from
                            non-Calico sources whereas the former is limited to packets

                                        \ P P  | The number of domains is less than
                                        5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                                        as 0. In this situation, new pod with the
                                        same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because

                                        ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule
                                        the pod in any location, but giving higher
                                        precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable"
                                        for an incoming pod if and only if every possible
                                        node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in
                                        a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and
                                        pods with the same labelSelector spread as
                                        3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule,
                                        incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                        to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1)
                                        on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other
                                        words, the cluster can still be imbalanced,
                                        but scheduler won''t make it *more* imbalanced.

                                        5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                                        as 0. In this situation, new pod with the

                                        incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)

                                            labels. Nodes that have a label with this
                                            key and identical values are considered
                                            to be in the same topology. We consider
                                            each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try
                                            to put balanced number of pods into each
                                            bucket. We define a domain as a particular
                                            instance of a topology. Also, we define
                                            an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes
                                            meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                                            and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey
                                            is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node
                                            is a domain of that topology. And, if
                                            TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",
                                            each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                            It's a required field.

                                            to schedule the pod in any location, but
                                            giving higher precedence to topologies
                                            that would help reduce the skew. A constraint
                                            is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming

                                            "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example,
                                            in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to
                                            1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                            spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3
                                            | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable
                                            is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod
                                            can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                            to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1)
                                            on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1).
