    **Added** support for space-delimited custom claims in JWT authorization policies by setting 
    the `PILOT_JWT_SPACE_DELIMITED_CLAIMS` environment variable in the Istiod deployment.
    This allows users to specify multiple values for a single custom claim in a space-separated format,
    enhancing flexibility against the current space-delimited approach by hardcoding values: scope and permission.
