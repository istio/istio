  **Promoted** `cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup` to default to `true`.
  This enables automatic reconciliation of iptables rules for existing ambient pods when the `istio-cni` DaemonSet is upgraded,
  eliminating the need to manually restart pods to get updated networking configuration.

  - title: Ambient iptables reconciliation enabled by default
    content: |
        Iptables reconciliation is now enabled by default for ambient workloads in this release. When a new `istio-cni` DaemonSet pod starts up,
        it will automatically inspect pods that were previously enrolled in the ambient mesh and upgrade their in-pod iptables rules to the current state
        if there are any differences. This feature can be disabled explicitly with `--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=false`.
