    **Added** `pilot-agent [args...] -- COMMAND [args...]` command. Start a custom
    command with/without envoy proxy. Rely on the previously added env
    `DISABLE_ENVOY` to control whether to start envoy proxy. The agent will
    be responsible for the cert generation/rotation and gRPC bootstrap file
    generation.
