    **Added** support for OpenTelemetry semantic convention-aligned service attribute enrichment
    for trace spans. When `serviceAttributeEnrichment: OTEL_SEMANTIC_CONVENTIONS` is set on the
    `OpenTelemetryTracingProvider` in `MeshConfig`, the `service.name` resource attribute is
    populated following the OTel K8s service attributes specification fallback chain. The
    Environment resource detector is also automatically enabled to allow additional resource
    attributes (`service.namespace`, `service.version`, `service.instance.id`) via the
    `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable.
