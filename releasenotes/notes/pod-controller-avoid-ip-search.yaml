- title: Change in behaviour of how Istio finds matching Pods for a given Proxy
  content: |
    In previous versions, Istio  would search for matching Pods for a given Proxy by IP address when it failed to find
    them by name and namespace. This behaviour is now disabled by default and can be enabled using the
    `ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP` feature flag. This will only impact users who are customizing the Istio Proxy and that
    are not correctly setting the Proxy ID and Metadata required to find the worload name. For context see https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/56502
