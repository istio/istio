  **Added** support for `deploymentAnnotations` in the istiod Helm chart. Users can now specify custom annotations to be applied to the istiod Deployment object, in addition to the existing `podAnnotations` support. This is useful for integration with monitoring tools, GitOps workflows, and policy enforcement systems that operate at the deployment level.
  
  Example usage:
  ```yaml
  deploymentAnnotations:
    example.com/owner: "platform-team"
    monitoring.cortex.io/scrape: "true"
  ```
