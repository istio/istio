    **Added** a `ambient.istio.io/connect-strategy` annotation to ServiceEntries to allow different connection semantics in ambient. Users can set this to FIRST_HEALTHY_RACE when DNS servers return multiple A records and the client should test each endpoint and pick the first one that results in a successful TCP connection.
