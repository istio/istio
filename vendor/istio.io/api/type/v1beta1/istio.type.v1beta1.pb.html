<h2 id="WorkloadSelector">WorkloadSelector</h2>
<section>
<p>WorkloadSelector specifies the criteria used to determine if a policy can be applied
to a proxy. The matching criteria includes the metadata associated with a proxy,
workload instance info such as labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other info
that the proxy provides to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are
specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload instance to be
selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.</p>
