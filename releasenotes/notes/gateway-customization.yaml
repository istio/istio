    **Added** support for customizations to [Gateway API Automated Deployments](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment).
    This includes both `istio` Gateway types (used for ingress and egress) as well as `istio-waypoint` Gateway types used for ambient mode waypoints.
    Users can now customize arbitrary elements of the generated Service, Deployment, ServiceAccount, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, and PodDisruptionBudget.
