    **Added** support for OpenTelemetry semantic convention-aligned service attribute enrichment
    for trace spans. When `serviceAttributeEnrichment: OTEL_SEMANTIC_CONVENTIONS` is set on the
    `OpenTelemetryTracingProvider` in `MeshConfig`, `service.name` is computed following the
    OTel K8s service attributes specification fallback chain. Additionally, `service.namespace`,
    `service.version`, and `service.instance.id` are injected as `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` on
    the sidecar at injection time, and the Environment resource detector is auto-enabled so
    Envoy picks up these attributes at startup.
