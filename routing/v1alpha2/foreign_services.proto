// Service registry entries describe describe the endpoints, ports and
// protocols of a white-listed set of mesh-external domains and IP blocks
// that services in the mesh are allowed to access.
//
// NOTE 1: If a foreign service has the same name as a service in the
// service registry, the foreign service's declaration will be given
// precedence.
//
// NOTE 2: There can be ONLY ONE ForeignServices configuration for the
// entire mesh.
//
// For example, the following foreign services configuration describes the
// set of services at https://example.com. Eventhough the services behind
// example.com have to be accessed via HTTPS, in order for the application to
// obtain metrics from Istio, a plain text port (HTTP over port 80) is
// declared in addition to a secure port (HTTPS over 443). Connections
// arriving at port 443 on the sidecar will be treated as opaque TCP
// connections and will be forwarded as is to the destination, with limited
// visibility into the application flow. Connections arriving on port 80 on
// the sidecar will be able to take advantage of Istio's advanced routing
// and policy enforcement features. The associated routing rule ensures
// that outbound connections from the sidecar to the destination service
// happen over HTTPS.
