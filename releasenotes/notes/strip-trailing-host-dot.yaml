releaseNotes:
- |
  **Improved** handling of hostnames with trailing dots by configuring Envoy to
   strip it. This replaces the `PILOT_ENABLE_ABSOLUTE_FQDN_VHOST_DOMAIN` feature
   flag and reduces route configuration size.

upgradeNotes:
  - title: Trailing dot handling change
    content: |
      The `PILOT_ENABLE_ABSOLUTE_FQDN_VHOST_DOMAIN` environment variable has been removed
      and will be ignored if set. This change is backwards compatible: existing requests
      continue to work. No user action is required.
