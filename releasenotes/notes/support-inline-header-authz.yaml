  - title: Support Inline Multi-values Header Match in Authz
    content: |
      This change supports a new attribute `request.experimental.inline.headers[X-inline-header]` in Authorization Policy, which uses safe regex
      match to split the header values concatenated by commas when matching. Before this change, the AuthorizationPolicy does not support matching on
      multiple-valued headers.
      For example, given an allow policy `Allow{header: x-foo, value: [a, b]}`, the request with inline header `{key: x-foo value: "a,b,c"}` will be allowed
      when using `request.experimental.inline.headers[X-inline-header]`, while this is not allowed when using `request.headers[X-inline-header]`.
      Note that this new attribute also supports prefix match, suffix match and present match for per header value.

  This change supports a new attribute `request.experimental.inline.headers[X-inline-header]` in Authorization Policy, which uses safe regex
  match to split the header values concatenated by commas when matching. Before this change, the AuthorizationPolicy does not support matching on
  multiple-valued headers.
  For example, given an allow policy `Allow{header: x-foo, value: [a, b]}`, the request with inline header `{key: x-foo value: "a,b,c"}` will be allowed
  when using `request.experimental.inline.headers[X-inline-header]`, while this is not allowed when using `request.headers[X-inline-header]`.
  Note that this new attribute also supports prefix match, suffix match and present match for per header value.
  
  When this attribute is used, you need to make sure the request being checked by this AuthorizationPolicy does following the inline header definition as per as per RFC7230, that inline headers treat headers
  with multiple inline values as a comma-delimited string. Otherwise, you shouldn't use this attribute.
