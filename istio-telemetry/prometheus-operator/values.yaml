  # Enabling this option will generate a Prometheus resource, causing the operator
  # to create a prometheus deployment according to the generated spec. It will also
  # create a service definition, destination rules, cluster roles and bindings, and
  # a service account. Only use this option if you have not already created and configured
  # a prometheus resource and/or you desire a distinct prometheus resource for Istio.
