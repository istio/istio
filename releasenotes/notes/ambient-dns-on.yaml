    **Promoted** the `cni.ambient.dnsCapture` value to default to `true`.
    This enables the DNS proxying for workloads in ambient mesh by default, improving security, performance, and enabling
    a number of features.
    This can be disabled explicitly or with `compatibilityVersion=1.24`.
    Note: only new pods will have DNS enabled. To enable for existing pods, they must be restarted.
