# Environment variables used to configure istio startup

# Comma separated list of CIDRs used for services. If set, iptables will be run to allow istio
# sidecar to intercept outbound calls to configured addresses. If not set, outbound istio sidecar
# will not be used via iptables.
# ISTIO_SERVICE_CIDR=

# Name of the service exposed by the machine.
# ISTIO_SERVICE=myservice

# Comma separated list of local ports that will use Istio sidecar for inbound services.
# If set, iptables rules will be configured to intercept inbound traffic and redirect to sidecar.
# If not set, no rules will be enabled
# ISTIO_INBOUND_PORTS=

# List of ports to exclude from inbound interception, if ISTIO_INBOUND_PORTS is set to *
# Port 22 is automatically excluded
# ISTIO_INBOUND_EXCLUDE_PORTS=

# Namespace of the cluster.
# ISTIO_NAMESPACE=default

# Specify the IP address used in endpoints. If not set, 'hostname --ip-address' will be used.
# Needed if the host has multiple IP.

# Fine tunning - useful if installing/building binaries instead of using the .deb file, or running
# multiple instances.

# Port used by Envoy. Defaults to 15001, used in the autogenerated config
# ENVOY_PORT=15001

# User running Envoy. For testing you can use a regular user ID - however running iptables requires
# root or netadmin capability. The debian file creates user istio.
# ENVOY_USER=istio-proxy

# Uncomment to enable debugging
# ISTIO_DEBUG="-l debug"

# Directory for stdout redirection. The redirection is required because envoy attempts to open
# /dev/stdout - must be a real file. Will be used for access logs. Additional config for logsaver
# needs to be made, envoy reopens the file on SIGUSR1

# Installation directory for istio binaries, customize in case you're using a binary.
# This is likely to change - current path matches the docker layout in 0.1
# ISTIO_BIN_BASE=/usr/local/bin

# Location of istio configs.
