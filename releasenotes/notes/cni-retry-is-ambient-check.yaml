  **Added** a retry mechanism when checking if a pod is ambient enabled in istio-cni.
  This is to address potential transient failures resulting in potential mesh bypassing. This feature
  is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting `ambient.enableAmbientDetectionRetry` in the
  `istio-cni` chart.
