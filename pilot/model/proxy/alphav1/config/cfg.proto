// Glossary & concepts
//
// Service is a unit of an application with a unique name that other services
// use to refer to the functionality being called. Service instances are
// pods/VMs/containers that implement the service.
//
// Service versions - In a continuous deployment scenario, for a given service,
// there can be multiple sets of instances running potentially different
// variants of the application binary. These variants are not necessarily
// different API versions. They could be iterative changes to the same service,
// deployed in different environments (prod, staging, dev, etc.). Common
// scenarios where this occurs include A/B testing, canary rollouts, etc. The
// choice of a particular version can be decided based on various criterion
// (headers, url, etc.) and/or by weights assigned to each version.  Each
// service has a default version consisting of all its instances.
//
// Source - downstream client (browser or another service) calling the
// proxy/sidecar (typically to reach another service).
//
// Destination - The remote upstream service to which the proxy/sidecar is
// talking to, on behalf of the source service. There can be one or more
// service versions for a given service (see the discussion on versions above).
// The proxy would choose the version based on various routing rules.
//
// Applications address only the destination service without knowledge of
// individual service versions. The actual choice of the version is determined
// by the proxy, enabling the application code to decouple itself from the
// evolution of dependent services.

// Proxy level global configurations go here
message ProxyMeshConfig {

// Destination declares policies that determine how to handle traffic for a
// destination service (load balancing policies, failure recovery policies such
// as timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, etc).  Policies are applicable per
// individual service versions. It is an error to define multiple policies for
// the same service version.

// enforced when the service is opening a connection/sending a request via the
