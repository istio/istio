    **Fixed** Gateway API hostname conflict detection between HTTPRoute and GRPCRoute. Routes of different types can no longer share the same hostname on the same Gateway listener, enforcing GEP-1016 "Cross Serving" rules. The first attached route wins, and conflicting routes are rejected with a clear error message.
