    **Added** `DISABLE_SHADOW_HOST_SUFFIX` environment variable to control shadow host suffix behavior in mirror policies. When set to `true` (default), shadow host suffixes are added to hostnames of mirrored requests. When set to `true`, shadow host suffixes are not added. 
    This provides backward compatibility for users upgrading from older Istio versions where shadow host suffixes were added by default via compatibility profiles.
