## Contributor license agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, you have to jump a
few legal hurdles.

Please fill out the [Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com).

Once you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests. This is necessary
because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution
becomes part of this project. So this agreement simply gives us permission
to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

## Contributing a patch

If you're working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express
interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is
active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a
   Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the repo, develop, and test your changes.
1. Submit a pull request.
