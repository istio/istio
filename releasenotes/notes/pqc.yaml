  **Added** `pqc` (post-quantum cryptography) option to `COMPLIANCE_POLICY`.
  This policy enforces TLS v1.3, cipher suites `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,
  and post-quantum-safe key exchange `X25519MLKEM768`.

  To enable this compliance policy in ambient mode, it must be set in pilot and ztunnel containers.
  
  This policy applies to the following data paths:
  * mTLS communication between Envoy proxies and ztunnels;
  * regular TLS on the downstream and the upstream of Envoy proxies (e.g. gateway);
  * Istiod xDS server.
