/*
Package handler defines EventHandlers that enqueue reconcile.Requests in response to Create, Update, Deletion Events
observed from Watching Kubernetes APIs.  Users should provide a source.Source and handler.EventHandler to
Controller.Watch in order to generate and enqueue reconcile.Request work items.

EventHandlers

EnqueueRequestForObject - Enqueues a reconcile.Request containing the Name and Namespace of the object in the Event.  This will
cause the object that was the source of the Event (e.g. the created / deleted / updated object) to be
reconciled.

EnqueueRequestForOwner - Enqueues a reconcile.Request containing the Name and Namespace of the Owner of the object in the Event.
This will cause owner of the object that was the source of the Event (e.g. the owner object that created the object)
to be reconciled.

EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc - Enqueues Reconciler.Requests resulting from a user provided transformation function run against the
object in the Event.  This will cause an arbitrary collection of objects (defined from a transformation of the
source object) to be reconciled.
