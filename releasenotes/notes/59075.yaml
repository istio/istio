    **Fixed** CNI config file permissions to default to 0600 instead of 0644 for CIS Kubernetes benchmark v1.12
    compliance. The previous permissions can be restored by setting `--cni-conf-mode=0644` or the
    `CNI_CONF_MODE` environment variable.

upgradeNotes:
  - title: CNI config file permissions changed to 0600
    content: |
      The default file permissions for CNI config files written by Istio have changed from 0644 to 0600.
      This aligns with the CIS Kubernetes benchmark v1.12 requirement. Since the CNI config is only read
      by the container runtime running as root, this should have no functional impact. If you have tooling
      that needs to read CNI config files as a non-root user, you can restore the previous behavior by
      setting `values.cni.cniConfMode=0644` or the `CNI_CONF_MODE=0644` environment variable on the
      istio-cni-node DaemonSet.
