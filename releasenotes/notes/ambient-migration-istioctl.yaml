  **Added** new `istioctl ambient migrate` command for sidecar to ambient mesh migration.
  The migration is performed in 7 phases (pre-reqs, cluster-setup, deploy-waypoints, migrate-policies, use-waypoints, policy-simplification, remove-sidecars) to ensure zero-downtime transition.
  Features fail-fast behavior, smart detection of existing resources, and automatic L7 policy migration to waypoint-compatible format.
