    **Added** a new representation of revision tags using cluster IP services, meant to stop using mutating webhooks in ambient mode.
    `istioctl tag set <tag> --revision <rev>` and the `revisionTags` helm value will both create a MutatingWebhook using the current
    specifications and a Service similar to the istiod Service but including the `istio.io/tag` label to store the mapping.
