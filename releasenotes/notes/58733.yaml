    **Added** CRL support in zTunnel. When ca-crl.pen file is provided via plugged-in CA, Istiod automatically
    distributes Certificate Revocation Lists to all participating namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows 
    zTunnel to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments 
    using plugged-in CAs.
