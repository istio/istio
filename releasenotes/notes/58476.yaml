  **Added** alpha support for a baggage-based telemetry system for ambient mesh. Users of multinetwork
  ambient will want to enable this feature via the `AMBIENT_ENABLE_BAGGAGE` pilot env var so that the
  metrics for cross-network traffic are properly attributed with source and destination labels. Note that
  ztunnel already sends baggage in requests; this feature just augments that functionality with waypoint
  generated baggage as well. As such, this feature is off by default for waypoints and on by default
  in ztunnels (configurable via the `ENABLE_RESPONSE_BAGGAGE` environment variable in ztunnel).
