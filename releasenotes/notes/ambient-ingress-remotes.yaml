    **Fixed** an issue where ingress gateways in ambient multi-cluster did not route requests to exposed remote backends. Also, a new feature flag `AMBIENT_ENABLE_MULTI_NETWORK_INGRESS` has been added and it's `true` by default. If the user wants to keep the old behaviour, it can be set to `false`.
