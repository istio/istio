/*
Protocol details:
on new connection from ztunnel to CNI, the CNI agent
- will send all the existing payloads (that it has in its cache) to the ztunnel using AddWorkload message.
- the ztunnel will send an ack for each payload (which the CNI will wait for before sending the next one).
- when the CNI finishes sending the content of its current cache, a SnapshotSent message will be sent.
- the ztunnel will then remove any entries from its cache that were not sent up to this point (as these entries do not exist in the CNI
  cache, and must have been deleted). ztunnel will ack the SnapshotSent message.
- from now on, ztunnel will expect only AddWorkload and DelWorkload messages.
