  **Fixed** Grafana dashboard linking in the Istio Mesh Dashboard. Workload and Service links now use dashboard UIDs instead of deprecated path-based linking, which stopped working in newer Grafana versions.

upgradeNotes:
- title: Regenerate Grafana dashboards after upgrade
  content: |
    If you use Istio's bundled Grafana dashboards, you'll need to regenerate them after upgrading to 
    get the fixed dashboard linking. Dashboard UIDs are now explicitly defined to enable stable links 
    between dashboards.
