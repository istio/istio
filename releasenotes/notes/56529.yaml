  **Added** CRL support for plugged-in CA, enabling Istio to watch for ca-crl.pem files and 
  automatically distribute Certificate Revocation Lists across all namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows 
  proxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments 
  using plugged-in CAs.
