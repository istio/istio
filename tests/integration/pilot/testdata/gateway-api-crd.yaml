        description: "GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the
          user for creating Gateway resources. \n It is recommended that this resource
          be used as a template for Gateways. This means that a Gateway is based on
          the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
          the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
          Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
          to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
          GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
          by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
          implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
          finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass
          associated with a Gateway is not deleted while in use. \n GatewayClass is
          a Cluster level resource."

                  in the group are \"compatible\". An implementation MAY also group
                  together and collapse compatible Listeners belonging to different
                  Gateways. \n For example, an implementation might consider Listeners
                  to be compatible with each other if all of the following conditions
                  are met: \n 1. Either each Listener within the group specifies the
                  \"HTTP\"    Protocol or each Listener within the group specifies
                  either    the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol. \n 2. Each Listener
                  within the group specifies a Hostname that is unique    within the
                  group. \n 3. As a special case, one Listener within a group may
                  omit Hostname,    in which case this Listener matches when no other
                  Listener    matches. \n If the implementation does collapse compatible
                  Listeners, the hostname provided in the incoming client request
                  MUST be matched to a Listener to find the correct set of Routes.
                  The incoming hostname MUST be matched using the Hostname field for
                  each Listener in order of most to least specific. That is, exact
                  matches must be processed before wildcard matches. \n If this field
                  specifies multiple Listeners that have the same Port value but are
                  not compatible, the implementation must raise a \"Conflicted\" condition
                  in the Listener status. \n Support: Core"

                  `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match. \n If hostnames

                        to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly

                        if at least one section in the parent resource accepts it.
                        For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can
                        attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1
                        of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing
                        Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached.
                        If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway. \n

                        alphabetical order by   \"<namespace>/<name>\". For example,
                        foo/bar is given precedence over   foo/baz. \n If ties still
                        exist within the Route that has been given precedence, matching
                        precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
