    **Improved** Use tag-stripped URL + checksum as a Wasm module cachekey, and the tagged URL is seperately cached. 
    This may increase the chance of cache hit (e.g., trying to find the same image with both of the tagged and digest URLs.)
    In addition, this will be a base to implement ImagePullPolicy.
