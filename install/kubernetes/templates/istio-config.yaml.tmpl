    # Along with discoveryRefreshDelay, this setting determines how
    # frequently should Envoy fetch and update its ntiernal configuration
    # from Istio Pilot. Lower refresh delay results in higher CPU
    # utilization and potential performance loss in exchange for faster
    # convergence. Tweak this value according to your setup.
