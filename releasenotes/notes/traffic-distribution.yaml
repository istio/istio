    **Added** support for the `Service.spec.trafficDistribution` field and `networking.istio.io/traffic-distribution` annotation, allowing a simpler mechanism to make traffic prefer geographically close endpoints.
    Note: this feature previously existed only for ztunnel, but is now supported across all data planes.
