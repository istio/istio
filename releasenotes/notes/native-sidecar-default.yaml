   **Promoted** the environment variable `ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS` to default to `true`. This means native sidecars will be injected into all eligible pods unless explicitly disabled. 
   This can be disabled explicitly or for specific workloads by adding the annotation `sidecar.istio.io/native-side: "false"` to individual pods or pod templates.

upgradeNotes:
  - title: Native sidecar enabled by default
    content: |
      Native sidecars are now enabled by default for eligible pods. This changes `istio-proxy`from a container to an init container. 
      This can cause compatibility issues with other mutating webhooks or controllers in your cluster that expect to modify the `istio-proxy` as a regular container.
      Please test your workloads and controllers to ensure they are compatible with this change.
