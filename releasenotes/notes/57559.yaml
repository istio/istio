    **Added** support for "persona-based" installations to our Helm charts based on the scope of generated/applied resources.
    If no `resourceScope` is set, all resources will be installed. This is the same behavior a user would expect from 1.27 charts.
    If `resourceScope` is set to `namespace`, only namespace-scoped resources will be installed.
    If `resourceScope` is set to `cluster`, only cluster-scoped resources will be installed.
    This can enable a kubernetes administrator to manage the resources in the cluster and the mesh administrator to manage the resources in the mesh.
    For the ztunnel chart, `resourceScope` is a top-level field. For all other charts, it is a field under `global`.
