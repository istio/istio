    **Fixed** a bug where DRs without workload selectors in the destination/root namespace were not applied if the source namespace only contained DRs with workloadselectors.
    This fix does not apply merging across namespaces. For example, if a DR in the source namespace has a workload selector and a DR in the destination namespace has no workload 
    selector, the fields of the DR in the destination namespace will not be merged with the DR in the source namespace.
