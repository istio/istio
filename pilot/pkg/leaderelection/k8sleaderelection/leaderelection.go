// Package leaderelection implements leader election of a set of endpoints.
// It uses an annotation in the endpoints object to store the record of the
// election state. This implementation does not guarantee that only one
// client is acting as a leader (a.k.a. fencing).
//
// A client only acts on timestamps captured locally to infer the state of the
// leader election. The client does not consider timestamps in the leader
// election record to be accurate because these timestamps may not have been
// produced by a local clock. The implementation does not depend on their
// accuracy and only uses their change to indicate that another client has
// renewed the leader lease. Thus the implementation is tolerant to arbitrary
// clock skew, but is not tolerant to arbitrary clock skew rate.
//
// However the level of tolerance to skew rate can be configured by setting
// RenewDeadline and LeaseDuration appropriately. The tolerance expressed as a
// maximum tolerated ratio of time passed on the fastest node to time passed on
// the slowest node can be approximately achieved with a configuration that sets
// the same ratio of LeaseDuration to RenewDeadline. For example if a user wanted
// to tolerate some nodes progressing forward in time twice as fast as other nodes,
// the user could set LeaseDuration to 60 seconds and RenewDeadline to 30 seconds.
//
// While not required, some method of clock synchronization between nodes in the
// cluster is highly recommended. It's important to keep in mind when configuring
// this client that the tolerance to skew rate varies inversely to master
// availability.
//
// Larger clusters often have a more lenient SLA for API latency. This should be
// taken into account when configuring the client. The rate of leader transitions
// should be monitored and RetryPeriod and LeaseDuration should be increased
// until the rate is stable and acceptably low. It's important to keep in mind
// when configuring this client that the tolerance to API latency varies inversely
// to master availability.
//
// DISCLAIMER: this is an alpha API. This library will likely change significantly
// or even be removed entirely in subsequent releases. Depend on this API at
// your own risk.
