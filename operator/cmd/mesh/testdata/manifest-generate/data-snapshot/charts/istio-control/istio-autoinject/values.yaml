  # injectedAnnotations are additional annotations that will be added to the pod spec after injection
  # This is primarily to support PSP annotations. For example, if you defined a PSP with the annotations:
  #
  # annotations:
  #   apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
  #   apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default
  #
  # The PSP controller would add corresponding annotations to the pod spec for each container. However, this happens before
  # the inject adds additional containers, so we must specify them explicitly here. With the above example, we could specify:
  # injectedAnnotations:
  #   container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/istio-init: runtime/default
  #   container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/istio-proxy: runtime/default

  # Specify the pod anti-affinity that allows you to constrain which nodes
  # your pod is eligible to be scheduled based on labels on pods that are
  # already running on the node rather than based on labels on nodes.
  # There are currently two types of anti-affinity:
  #    "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
  #    "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
  # which denote "hard" vs. "soft" requirements, you can define your values
  # in "podAntiAffinityLabelSelector" and "podAntiAffinityTermLabelSelector"
  # correspondingly.
  # For example:
  # podAntiAffinityLabelSelector:
  # - key: security
  #   operator: In
  #   values: S1,S2
  #   topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  # This pod anti-affinity rule says that the pod requires not to be scheduled
  # onto a node if that node is already running a pod with label having key
  # "security" and value "S1".

  # You can use the field called alwaysInjectSelector and neverInjectSelector which will always inject the sidecar or
