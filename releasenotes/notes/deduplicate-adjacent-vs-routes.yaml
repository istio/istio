    This change improves the routing configuration by deduplicating adjacent routes in a virtual service.
    This means that if two routes are adjacent and reduce to the same match conditions, only the first route
    will be kept. This should result in more efficient routing configurations generated from some large virtual 
    services, especially those that match on properties of the source proxy itself.
