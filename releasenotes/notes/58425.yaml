    **Added** support for filtering resources that Pilot will watch, based on the environment variable `PILOT_IGNORE_RESOURCES`.
    This variable is a comma-separated list of resources and prefixes that should be ignored by Istio CRD Watcher.
    In case there is a need to explicitly include a resource, even it being on the ignore list it can be done
    using the variable `PILOT_INCLUDE_RESOURCES`.
    This feature enables administrators that want to deploy Istio as a Gateway API only controller, ignoring mesh resources, 
    or allowing the deployment of Istio with support only for Gateway API HTTPRoutes (eg.: GAMMA support).
