  # a prometheus resource and/or you desire a distinct prometheus resource for Istio.

  # Specify the pod anti-affinity that allows you to constrain which nodes
  # your pod is eligible to be scheduled based on labels on pods that are
  # already running on the node rather than based on labels on nodes.
  # There are currently two types of anti-affinity:
  #    "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
  #    "preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
  # which denote "hard" vs. "soft" requirements, you can define your values
  # in "podAntiAffinityLabelSelector" and "podAntiAffinityTermLabelSelector"
  # correspondingly.
  # For example:
  # podAntiAffinityLabelSelector:
  # - key: security
  #   operator: In
  #   values: S1,S2
  #   topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  # This pod anti-affinity rule says that the pod requires not to be scheduled
  # onto a node if that node is already running a pod with label having key
  # "security" and value "S1".
