  **Added** Ability to safely restart/upgrade the system-node-critical `istio-cni` node agent Daemonset in-place. This works by preventing new pods from starting on the node while `istio-cni` is being restarted or upgraded. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the environment variable `AMBIENT_DISABLE_SAFE_UPGRADE=true` in `istio-cni`.
