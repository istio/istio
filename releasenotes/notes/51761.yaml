  **Fixed** an issue where the `cluster_name` and `http_conn_manager_prefix` label was incorrectly truncated for services without a `.svc.cluster.local` suffix
upgradeNote:
- title: Custom stat names
  content: |
    Previously, the Envoy cluster metrics for services that did not have a `.svc.cluster.local` suffix
    were incorrectly truncated and parsed. This was due to the fact that Envoy cluster metrics use dots "." as
    a delimeter between metric namespaces, and it is impossible to properly distinguish between those
    delimeters and the dots in hostnames/cluster names. To address this, the regex for parsing the cluster_name
    has been updated to look for a semicolon to indicate the end of the cluster name. If you're using
    the `inbound_cluster_stat_name` or `outbound_cluster_stat_name` fields in meshconfig, the semicolon
    will be added automatically for you. If you have any dependency on the full stat name for cluster metrics,
    you will need to update your monitoring system to account for this change. To revert to the old behavior,
    you can set the `ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX` env var via proxyConfig or specify the 1.22 compatibility
    version.
