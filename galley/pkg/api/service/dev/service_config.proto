    // interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule.  Thus, when a

    // virtual host matching.  In Consul, a plain service name would be resolved to
    // the FQDN "reviews.service.consul".

    // Note that the hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP
    // services. Service inside the mesh, i.e. those found in the service
    // registry, must always be referred to using their alphanumeric
    // names. IP addresses or CIDR prefixes are allowed as alias via the Gateway section.
