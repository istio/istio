    **Fixed** When AllowInsecureFallback is specified in the Gateway TLS configuration with client certificate validation, 
    Istio now correctly maps it to OPTIONAL_MUTUAL TLS mode instead of the default MUTUAL mode. 
    This allows connections to succeed even when client certificate validation fails, 
    aligning with the Gateway API v1.4 specification.
