  **Added** alpha support for specifying ServiceScope in the MeshConfig in ambient multicluster configurations.
  ServiceScope enables the selection of individual services or services in a namespace to be global or local.
  A locally scoped service is only discoverable by the data plane in the same cluster as the service. A local
  service is not discoverable by the data planes in other clusters. A globally scoped service is discoverable
  by the data planes in all clusters. Defining selectors for the serviceScopeConfigs determines which services
  and workloads are shared with the data plane and which clusters and listeners are configured for the waypoints
  (including e/w gateways) in the mesh.
