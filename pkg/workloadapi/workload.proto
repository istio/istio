// Address represents a unique address.
//
// Address joins two sub-resources, Workload and Service, to support querying by IP address.
// Address is intended to be able to be looked up on-demand, allowing a client
// to answer a question like "what is this IP address", similar to a reverse DNS lookup.
//
// Each resource will have a mesh-wide unique opaque name, defined in the individual messages.
// In addition, to support lookup by IP address, they will have *alias* names for each IP the resource represents.
// There may be multiple aliases for the same resource (examples: service in multiple networks, or a dual-stack workload).
// Aliases are keyed by network/IP address. Example: "default/1.2.3.4".
//
// In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Workload. For instance, we may simply know
// that there is a workload behind a gateway, and rely on the gateway to handle the rest.
// In this case, the key format will be "resource-uid". The resource can be a Pod, WorkloadEntry, etc.
// These resources cannot be looked up on-demand.
//
// In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Service. These services cannot be used for matching
// outbound traffic, as we only have L4 attributes to route based on. However,
// they can be used for Gateways.
// In this case, the key format will be "network/hostname".
// These resources cannot be looked up on-demand.
