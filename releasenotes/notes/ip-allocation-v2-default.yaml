    **Promoted** the `PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE` value to default to `true`.
    This enables the new iteration of [IP auto-allocation](/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/#address-auto-allocation),
    fixing long-standing issues around allocation instability, ambient support, and increased visibility.
    `ServiceEntry` objects without `spec.address` set will now see a new field, `status.addresses`, automatically set.
    Note these will not be used unless proxies are configured to do DNS proxying, which remains off-by-default.
