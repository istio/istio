  **Added** support for TLS passthrough listeners on east-west gateways, allowing
  non-HBONE ports to be exposed via the Gateway API (e.g., to route traffic to
  the Kubernetes API server across network boundaries). This behavior is gated
  behind the `ALLOW_EASTWEST_TLS_PASSTHROUGH` environment variable (default:
  `false`) and requires `AMBIENT_ENABLE_MULTI_NETWORK` to be enabled.
