releaseNotes:
- |
  **Added** `timeout` and `headers` fields to `ZipkinTracingProvider` in MeshConfig extensionProviders.
  The `timeout` field configures the HTTP request timeout when sending spans to the Zipkin collector,
  providing better control over trace export reliability. The `headers` field allows including custom
  HTTP headers for authentication, authorization, and custom metadata use cases. Headers support both
  direct values and environment variable references for secure credential management.
