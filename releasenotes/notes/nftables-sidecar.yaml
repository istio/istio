    **Added** support for native nftables when using Istio sidecar mode. This update makes it possible to use nftables
    instead of iptables to manage network rules, offering more efficient approach to traffic redirection for pods and
    services. To enable the nftables mode, use "--set values.global.nativeNftables=true" at the time of installation.
