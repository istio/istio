# Consul License

Command: `consul license`

<%= enterprise_alert :consul %>

The `license` command provides datacenter-level management of the Consul Enterprise license. This was added in Consul 1.1.0.

If ACLs are enabled then a token with operator privileges may be required in
order to use this command. Requests are forwarded internally to the leader
if required, so this can be run from any Consul node in a cluster. See the
[ACL Guide](/docs/guides/acl.html#operator) for more information.
