                        name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following
                        deviations from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in
                        the RFC: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. The `:` delimiter is
                        not respected because ports are not allowed. \n Incoming requests
                        are matched against the hostnames before the HTTPRoute rules.
                        If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on the

                        http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard,
                        then the request matches this rule if    the http host header
                        is to equal to the suffix    (removing the first label) of
