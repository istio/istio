    **Improved** installation on GKE. When deploying with `global.platform=gke`, required `ResourceQuota` resources are deployed automatically.
    Additionally, when installing via `istioctl`, the `global.platform=gke` setting is automatically enabled when GKE is detected.
    In addition to the new `ResourceQuota` resources, this also automatically configures the required `cniBinDir`.
