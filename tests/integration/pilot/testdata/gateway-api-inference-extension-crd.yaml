              InferenceObjectiveSpec represents the desired state of a specific model use case. This resource is
              managed by the "Inference Workload Owner" persona.

              The Inference Workload Owner persona is someone that trains, verifies, and
              leverages a large language model from a model frontend, drives the lifecycle
              and rollout of new versions of those models, and defines the specific
              performance and latency goals for the model. These workloads are
              expected to operate within an InferencePool sharing compute capacity with other
              InferenceObjectives, defined by the Inference Platform Admin.

              InferenceObjective's modelName (not the ObjectMeta name) is unique for a given InferencePool,
              if the name is reused, an error will be shown on the status of a
              InferenceObjective that attempted to reuse. The oldest InferenceObjective, based on
              creation timestamp, will be selected to remain valid. In the event of a race
              condition, one will be selected at random.

                description: |-
                  Priority defines how important it is to serve the request compared to other requests in the same pool.
                  Priority is an integer value that defines the priority of the request.
                  The higher the value, the more critical the request is; negative values _are_ allowed.
                  No default value is set for this field, allowing for future additions of new fields that may 'one of' with this field.
                  However, implementations that consume this field (such as the Endpoint Picker) will treat an unset value as '0'.
                  Priority is used in flow control, primarily in the event of resource scarcity(requests need to be queued).
                  All requests will be queued, and flow control will _always_ allow requests of higher priority to be served first.
                  Fairness is only enforced and tracked between requests of the same priority.

                  Example: requests with Priority 10 will always be served before
                  requests with Priority of 0 (the value used if Priority is unset or no InfereneceObjective is specified).
                  Similarly requests with a Priority of -10 will always be served after requests with Priority of 0.

                  Parents is a list of parent resources, typically Gateways, that are associated with
                  the InferencePool, and the status of the InferencePool with respect to each parent.

                  A controller that manages the InferencePool, must add an entry for each parent it manages
                  and remove the parent entry when the controller no longer considers the InferencePool to
                  be associated with that parent.

                  A maximum of 32 parents will be represented in this list. When the list is empty,
                  it indicates that the InferencePool is not associated with any parents.

                  Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the InferencePool, and the status of the InferencePool with respect to
                  each parent.

                  A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. When the list contains
                  `kind: Status, name: default`, it indicates that the InferencePool is not
                  associated with any Gateway and a controller must perform the following:

                   - Remove the parent when setting the "Accepted" condition.
                   - Add the parent when the controller will no longer manage the InferencePool
                     and no other parents exist.
