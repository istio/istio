    **Improved** the ztunnel Helm chart to no longer set resource names to `.Release.Name`, and instead default to `ztunnel`.
    This reverts a change in Istio 1.25.

  - title: Ztunnel Helm chart changes
    content: |
      In Istio 1.25, the resources in the ztunnel Helm chart were changed to be named `.Resource.Name`.
      This often caused issues, as the name needs to be kept in sync with the Istiod Helm chart.
      
      In this release, we have reverted to default to a static `ztunnel` name again.
      As previously, this can be overriden with `--set resourceName=my-custom-name`.
