/*
Reconciler implements a Kubernetes API for a specific Resource by Creating, Updating or Deleting Kubernetes
objects, or by making changes to systems external to the cluster (e.g. cloudproviders, github, etc).

reconcile implementations compare the state specified in an object by a user against the actual cluster state,
and then perform operations to make the actual cluster state reflect the state specified by the user.

Typically, reconcile is triggered by a Controller in response to cluster Events (e.g. Creating, Updating,
Deleting Kubernetes objects) or external Events (GitHub Webhooks, polling external sources, etc).

Example reconcile Logic:

	* Reader an object and all the Pods it owns.
	* Observe that the object spec specifies 5 replicas but actual cluster contains only 1 Pod replica.
	* Create 4 Pods and set their OwnerReferences to the object.

reconcile may be implemented as either a type:

	type reconcile struct {}

	func (reconcile) reconcile(controller.Request) (controller.Result, error) {
		// Implement business logic of reading and writing objects here
		return controller.Result{}, nil
	}

Or as a function:

	controller.Func(func(o controller.Request) (controller.Result, error) {
		// Implement business logic of reading and writing objects here
		return controller.Result{}, nil
	})

Reconciliation is level-based, meaning action isn't driven off changes in individual Events, but instead is
driven by actual cluster state read from the apiserver or a local cache.
For example if responding to a Pod Delete Event, the Request won't contain that a Pod was deleted,
instead the reconcile function observes this when reading the cluster state and seeing the Pod as missing.

	// Result.Requeue is true, otherwise upon completion it will remove the work from the queue.
	Reconcile(Request) (Result, error)
