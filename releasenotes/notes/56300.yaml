  **Fixed** Regression in Istio 1.26.0 that caused a panic in istiod when processing Gateway API hostnames. 
  The issue occurred in a setup with multiple gateways targeting the same workload, while merging gateways into a single logical Gateway, 
  due to inconsistent handling of namespace-prefixed hostname formats during concurrent reconciliation operations.
