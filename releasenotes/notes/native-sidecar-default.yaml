   **Native sidecars are now enabled by default**. The environment variable `ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS` is now set to `true` by default, which means native sidecars will be injected into all eligible pods unless explicitly disabled. 
   Users can still disable native sidecars for specific workloads by adding the annotation `sidecar.istio.io/native-side: "false"` to individual pods or pod templates.
