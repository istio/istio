    **Upgraded** Gateway API support to v1.4. This introduces support for `BackendTLSPolicy` `v1`.
upgradeNotes:
  - title: "`BackendTLSPolicy` alpha removal"
    content: |
      The support for the `v1alpha3 version of `BackendTLSPolicy` has been removed. Only `v1` `BackendTLSPolicy` is supported.

      Please note that, prior to this release, `BackendTLSPolicy` was ignored by Istio unless the `PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true` option
      was explicitly enabled. As the policy is now `v1`, this setting is no longer required.
