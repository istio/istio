releaseNotes:
  - |
    **Added** a new `service.istio.io/workload-name` label that can be added to a `Pod` or `WorkloadEntry` to override the "workload name" reported in telemetry.
  - |
    **Added** a fallback to use the `WorkloadGroup` name as the "workload name" (as reported in telemetry) for `WorkloadEntry`s created by a `WorkloadGroup`.
