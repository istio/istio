// to answer a question like "what is this IP address", similar to a reverse DNS lookup.
// Keyed by network/IP address. Example: "default/1.2.3.4".
//
// In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Workload. For instance, we may simply know
// that there is a workload behind a gateway, and rely on the gateway to handle the rest.
// In this case, the key format will be "network/resource-uid". The resource can be a Pod, WorkloadEntry, etc.
// These resources cannot be looked up on-demand.
//
// In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Service. These services cannot be used for matching
// outbound traffic, as we only have L4 attributes to route based on. However,
// they can be used for Gateways.
// In this case, the key format will be "network/hostname".
