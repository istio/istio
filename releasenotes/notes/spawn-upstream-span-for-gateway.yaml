    content: |
        The environment variable `PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY` is now set to `true` by default.
        This change enables the spawning of upstream spans for gateway requests by default, enhancing
        observability for services behind the gateway. Users who prefer the previous behavior can
        explicitly set this variable to `false` in their configuration.
