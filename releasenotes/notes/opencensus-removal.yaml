    **Removed** OpenCensus support

- title: OpenCensus support has been removed
  content: |
    Because Envoy has removed [OpenCensus tracing extension](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.33/v1.33.0.html#incompatible-behavior-changes), we have
    removed OpenCensus support from Istio. If you are using OpenCensus, you should migrate to OpenTelemetry.
