  **Added** the `DAC_OVERRIDE` capability to the `istio-cni-node` DaemonSet. This fixes issues when running in environments
  where certain files are owned by non-root users.
  Note: prior to Istio 1.24, the `istio-cni-node` ran as `privileged`. Istio 1.24 removed this, but removed some required
  privileges which are now added back. Relatively to Istio 1.23, `istio-cni-node` still has fewer privileges than it does with this change.
