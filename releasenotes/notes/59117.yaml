    **Fixed** an issue where baggage-based peer metadata discovery interferred with TLS or
    PROXY traffic policies. As a short term fix we disable baggage-based metadata discovery
    for routes with TLS or PROXY traffic policies configured which may result in incomplete
    telemetry in multicluster deployments. We are working on addressing this limitation in
    the future releases.
