    **Improved** the ztunnel Helm chart to set resource names to `.Release.Name` instead of hard-coded to ztunnel.

  - title: Ztunnel Helm chart changes
    content: |
      In previous releases, resources in the ztunnel Helm chart were always named `ztunnel`.
      In this release, they are now named `.Resource.Name`.
      
      If you are installing the chart with a release name other than `ztunnel`, the resource names will change, triggering downtime.
      In this scenario, it is recommended to set `--set resourceName=ztunnel` to override back to the previous default.
