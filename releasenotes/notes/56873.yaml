    **Fixed** JWT filter configuration to include custom space-delimited claims

    The JWT filter configuration now correctly includes user-specified custom space-delimited claims in addition to the default claims ("scope" and "permission").
    This ensures that the Envoy JWT filter treats these claims as space-delimited strings, allowing for proper validation of JWT tokens that include these claims.
    To set custom space-delimited claims, use the `spaceDelimitedClaims` field in the JWT rule configuration inside the `RequestAuthentication` resource.
