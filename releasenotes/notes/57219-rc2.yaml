- title: InferencePool
  content: |
    The InferencePool API v1.0.0-rc.1 has been replaced with v1.0.0-rc.2. In this version, `inferencePool.spec.endpointPickerRef.portNumber`
    field has been replaced with `inferencePool.spec.endpointPickerRef.port.number`. The `inferencePool.spec.endpointPickerRef.port` field
    is a non-pointer and required when `inferencePool.spec.endpointPickerRef.kind` is unset or "Service". The port number 9002 is no longer
    inferred. Update your configurations to use the new API version.
