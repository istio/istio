    **Fixed** pilot-agent to support multiple concurrent xDS connections.
    Previously, only a single xDS connection was supported, which led to
    "registered overlapping stream" warnings and high xds request failure rates
    for grpc-go in proxyless mode. This fixes interoperability with grpc-go 1.66.0+

upgradeNotes:
  - title: pilot-agent now supports multiple xDS connections
    content: |
      pilot-agent (grpc-agent mode) now handles multiple concurrent xDS client connections.
      This enables compatibility with grpc-go 1.66.0+ which creates separate
      xDS clients per named service. No configuration changes required - the
      feature works automatically.
      
      **Impact**: Services using grpc-go proxyless can upgrade beyond version 1.65.0.
      
      **Architecture**: Each downstream client connection creates its own
      upstream connection to istiod (1:1 mapping), maintaining independent xDS
      state (nonces, ACKs, resource watches). This may result in increased
      concurrent connections at istiod.
