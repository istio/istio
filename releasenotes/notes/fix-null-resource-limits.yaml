  **Fixed** an issue where Istio proxy injection and gateway generation (including Waypoint, gRPC agent, and Ambient gateways) would fail when resource limits or requests were set to `null` in the configuration. This addresses the `cpu request must be less than or equal to cpu limit of 0` validation error that occurred when specific resource fields were null and other containers (like init containers) were present.
