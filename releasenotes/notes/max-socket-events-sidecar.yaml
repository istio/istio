  **Updated** the default value of maximum connections to accept per socket event to 1
  for inbound and outbound listeners built for sidecars that explicitly bind to ports.
  This allows for listeners built without IPTABLES interception to benefit from better 
  performance under high connection churn scenarios. To get the old behavior, you can 
  set `MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP` to zero.
