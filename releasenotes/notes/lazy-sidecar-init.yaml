  **Added** feature ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION that allows to enable lazy initialization of sidecar resources,
  Only computing internal indexes when SidecarScopes are actually used by a Proxy. This feature superseds the
  previous PILOT_CONVERT_SIDECAR_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY which would allow concurrent conversion with specific given concurrency,
  instead ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION will use the same concurrency as PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE.
