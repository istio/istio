kind: feature

area: security

issue:
  - https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57004

releaseNotes: 
  - Added support for configuring `seccompProfile` in the `istio-validation` and `istio-proxy` containers within the sidecar injection template. Users can now set the `seccompProfile.type` to `RuntimeDefault` for enhanced security compliance.

upgradeNotes:
  - title: Enabling seccompProfile for Sidecar Containers
    content: |
      To enable the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile for `istio-validation` and `istio-proxy` containers, set the following in your Istio configuration:
      ```yaml
      global:
        proxy:
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
      ```
      This change allows for better security practices by using the default seccomp profile provided by the container runtime.

securityNotes: 
  - The addition of `seccompProfile` support enhances the security posture of Istio by allowing users to leverage the `RuntimeDefault` profile, which restricts the system calls available to the containers, reducing the attack surface.
