  **Added** Support for reconciling in-pod iptables rules of existing ambient pods from the previous version on `istio-cni` upgrade. Feature can be toggled with `--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true` and will be enabled by default in future releases.

  - title: Ambient pod upgrade reconcilation.
    content: |
      When a new `istio-cni` Daemonset pod starts up, it will inspect pods that were previously enrolled in the ambient mesh, and upgrade their in-pod iptables rules to the current state if there is a diff or delta. This is off by default as of 1.25.0, but will eventually be enabled by default. Feature can be enabled by `helm install cni --set ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true` (helm) or `istioctl install --set values.cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true` (istioctl)
