              InferenceModelSpec represents the desired state of a specific model use case. This resource is
              managed by the "Inference Workload Owner" persona.

              The Inference Workload Owner persona is someone that trains, verifies, and
              leverages a large language model from a model frontend, drives the lifecycle
              and rollout of new versions of those models, and defines the specific
              performance and latency goals for the model. These workloads are
              expected to operate within an InferencePool sharing compute capacity with other
              InferenceModels, defined by the Inference Platform Admin.

              InferenceModel's modelName (not the ObjectMeta name) is unique for a given InferencePool,
              if the name is reused, an error will be shown on the status of a
              InferenceModel that attempted to reuse. The oldest InferenceModel, based on
              creation timestamp, will be selected to remain valid. In the event of a race
              condition, one will be selected at random.

              criticality:
                description: |-
                  Criticality defines how important it is to serve the model compared to other models referencing the same pool.
                  Criticality impacts how traffic is handled in resource constrained situations. It handles this by
                  queuing or rejecting requests of lower criticality. InferenceModels of an equivalent Criticality will
                  fairly share resources over throughput of tokens. In the future, the metric used to calculate fairness,
                  and the proportionality of fairness will be configurable.

                  ModelNames must be unique for a referencing InferencePool
                  (names can be reused for a different pool in the same cluster).
                  The modelName with the oldest creation timestamp is retained, and the incoming
                  InferenceModel's Ready status is set to false with a corresponding reason.
                  In the rare case of a race condition, one Model will be selected randomly to be considered valid, and the other rejected.
                  Names can be reserved without an underlying model configured in the pool.
                  This can be done by specifying a target model and setting the weight to zero,
                  an error will be returned specifying that no valid target model is found.

                        Weight is used to determine the proportion of traffic that should be
                        sent to this model when multiple target models are specified.

                        Weight defines the proportion of requests forwarded to the specified
                        model. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
                        TargetModels list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
                        the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                        implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                        weights does not need to equal 100.

                        If a weight is set for any targetModel, it must be set for all targetModels.
                        Conversely weights are optional, so long as ALL targetModels do not specify a weight.

                    LabelValue is the value of a label. This is used for validation
                    of maps. This matches the Kubernetes label validation rules:
                    * must be 63 characters or less (can be empty),
                    * unless empty, must begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]),
                    * could contain dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

                    Valid values include:

                    * MyValue
                    * my.name

                  Selector defines a map of labels to watch model server pods
                  that should be included in the InferencePool.
                  In some cases, implementations may translate this field to a Service selector, so this matches the simple
                  map used for Service selectors instead of the full Kubernetes LabelSelector type.
                  If sepecified, it will be applied to match the model server pods in the same namespace as the InferencePool.
