# Bug report Tool

A tool for building up bug reports. It is normally included in istioctl, but we
have added a shell script (build.sh) for building out the binaries
manually. This will allow us to distribute the binaries separately for past
builds of ASM.

## Building binaries

To build a tarball with the binaries, run `./build.sh` from inside this folder
(`/tools/bug-report`).
