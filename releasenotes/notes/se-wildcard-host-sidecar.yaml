    **Added** DYNAMIC_DNS wildcard ServiceEntry support for sidecar proxies for both MESH_INTERNAL and MESH_EXTERNAL locations. 
    Enables L7 HTTP routing (via Host header) and L4 TLS routing (via SNI) with observability for wildcard hosts (e.g., `*.example.com`)
    in traditional sidecar mode. Note that it is possible to spoof SNI for TLS connections that match the wildcard host. 
    E.g. a client connecting to `foo.example.com` could connect via SE `*.example.com`  while having SNI set to `bar.example.com`.
