    **Fixed** missing `PILOT_ENABLE_NODE_UNTAINT_CONTROLLERS` environment variable in `istiod` deployment when enabling untaint controller.
upgradeNotes:
  - title: Untaint controller
    content: |
      If you enabled untaint controller using `taint.enabled` Helm value when deploying `istiod` chart, you previously also had to set the `PILOT_ENABLE_NODE_UNTAINT_CONTROLLERS` environment variable in the `istiod` deployment to `true`. This is no longer required, as the variable is now set automatically when the untaint controller is enabled.
